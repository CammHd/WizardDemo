# WizardDemo Plugin. For collaborators of the Bedwars plugin.

Coding is like learning a different language. 
It's great when you get to teach others, and this is exactly what this plugin is for.

Kinda like a **blowfish** team.
Key to *decrypting* how things work, is **persistence** .

Same as with coding. :D
